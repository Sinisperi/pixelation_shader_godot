Let's start by figuring out what this effect is all about.
The key concept in here is the image resolution.
As you know, every picture consists of pixels, if you don't know this information, well.. i have bad news for you.
The bigger the picture, the more pixels there are.
Here I have a regular Godot icon and the one that is twice smaller.
The smaller one has twice as less pixels as the regular one.
And if we were to scale this small version up to match the size of the regular one, we would get the desired effect.

And this is exactly what is happening.
Let's get to the shader.
